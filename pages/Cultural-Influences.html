                Throughout the years, the term and title Tom and Jerry became practically synonymous with never-ending rivalry, as much as the related &quot;cat and mouse fight&quot; metaphor has. Yet in Tom and Jerry it was not the more powerful Tom who usually came out on top. In 2005, TV Asahi ranked Tom and Jerry as 58th of the Top 100 Animated TV Series in Japan overall, outranking titles like Rurouni Kenshin, Initial D, and even Macross. In January 2009, IGN named Tom and Jerry as the 66th best in the Top 100 Animated TV Shows.

                In 1973, the magazine National Lampoon referenced Tom and Jerry in a violence-filled comic book parody, Kit 'n' Kaboodle. In The Simpsons, The Itchy & Scratchy Show is a spoof of Tom and Jerryâ€”a &quot;cartoon within a cartoon&quot;. In an episode of the series titled &quot;Krusty Gets Kancelled&quot;, Worker and Parasite, a replacement cartoon for Itchy & Scratchy, is a reference to Soviet-era animation.
